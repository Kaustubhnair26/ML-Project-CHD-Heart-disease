# ML-Project-CHD-Heart-disease
ML project on coronary heart disease prediction.
This project has been done by me and my teammate Lakshay Jain.
Coronary Heart Disease Prediction is a GitHub repository that focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the risk of coronary heart disease. The repository provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing various factors and features related to an individual's health, such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. By utilizing a dataset containing historical medical records, the machine learning model is trained to classify whether a person is at high or low risk of developing coronary heart disease. The project includes data preprocessing techniques, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The goal of this repository is to offer a valuable tool for healthcare professionals and researchers to predict and assess the risk of coronary heart disease in individuals, aiding in early intervention and preventive measures.
